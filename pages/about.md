## About the Collection

This collection was curated using the digital archives of various museum collections in the endeavor to put materials from across the world in conversation with each other by locating them in the digital space. As a topic, I have focused on depictions of kitsune - Japanese fox spirits - in a variety of artistic mediums, including paintings, prints, theatrical props, and other artefacts. The purpose of this collection is exploration and connection. 

This collection has been curated as part of an academic project and is not meant for public dissemination. I do not own any of the artworks included.
