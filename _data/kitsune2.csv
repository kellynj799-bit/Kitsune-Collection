2_3,2,new_years_foxfire.jpg,"New Year's Eve Foxfires at the Changing Tree, Ōji",Utagawa Hiroshige (1797–1858),"ca. 1857, Edo period","Foxes gather at the large, old enoki (hackberry) tree on New Year's Eve to prepare to pay homage at the Ōji Inari shrine, the headquarters of the Inari cult in eastern Japan (Kantō). The cult centers on the god of the rice field, for whom the fox serves as messenger. On the way to Ōji, the foxes have set a number of kitsunebi (foxfires), which farmers count to predict the upcoming rice harvest. Hiroshige's print successfully conveys the mysterious atmosphere of the rite as the procession of foxes bearing fires approaches from the distant, dark forest under a starry sky. Dimensions:

3_1,3,hakuzosu.jpg,Hakuzosu the Fox-Spirit,Ōtagaki Rengetsu (1791–1875),Edo period (1615-1868),"This lightly brushed image of a fox garbed as a Buddhist nun acquires a clever, perhaps personal dimension in the poem that the nun Rengetsu inscribed in her much-admired script. The delicate vivacity of its classic style well suits her vision of a long-standing superstition holding that foxes transform themselves into human form to bewitch the unwary, particularly at twilight. There is a play of word and image elucidated by the donor of this scroll. The word obana, written with characters meaning ""tail-flower,"" is classic poetic diction for autumn plumes of susuki, the tall grasses painted here to signify Sagano, a place name often used in poetry as a pun on saga, ""one's nature.""
